## [0.5] - 2016-08-15

This version introduces a new timezone library which improves
timezone switching and behavior around DST transition times.

### Added

- Adds a new timezone library to properly normalize and localize datetimes.
``Pendulum`` no longer relies on ``pytz``.
Check the [Documentation](https://pendulum.eustace.io/docs/#timezones) to see what has changed exactly.

This version mostly brings the new ``Period`` class and improves performances overall.

- Adds the `Period` class, which basically is a datetime-aware interval.

### Changed

- Makes the `format()` method support a `locale` keyword argument.
- Changes custom directives. `%P` becomes `%_z` and `%t` becomes `%_t`.
Basically, all new custom directives will be in the form `%_{directive}`.

### Fixed

- Fixes singular for negative values of intervals.


## [0.3.1] - 2016-07-13

### Fixed

- Fixes parsing of string with partial offset.


## [0.3] - 2016-07-11

This version causes major breaking API changes to simplify it and making it more intuitive.

### Added

- Improves testing by providing a `test()` contextmanager.


### Changed

- Makes passing a naive `datetime` to `instance()` default to `UTC`.
- Reduces `add_xxx()`/`sub_xxx()` methods to `add(**kwargs)`/`subtract(**kwargs)`.
- Changes the `for_humans()` method of the `Interval` class to `in_words()` to avoid confusion with the `diff_for_humans()` method.
- Makes more constants and methods available at module level.
- Makes the constructor behave like the standard one. No more `Pendulum()`.
- Renames the `to()` method to `in_timezone()`.
- Removes the comparison methods to just stick with the basic operators.
- Reduces `first_of_xxx()`/`last_of_xxx()`/`nth_of_xxx()` methods to `first_of(unit)`/`last_of(unit)`/`nth_of(unit, nth)`.
- Reduces `start_of_xxx()`/`end_of_xxx()` methods to `start_of(unit)`/`end_of(unit)`.
- Removes the `diff_in_xxx()` methods from the `Pendulum` and adds `in_xxx()` methods to the `Interval` class.
- Renames the `PendulumInterval` class to simply `Interval`.
- Makes the `Pendulum` class immutable.

### Fixed

- Fixes "sl" locale.


## [0.2] - 2016-07-04
